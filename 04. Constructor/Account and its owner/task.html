<h2>Account and its owner</h2>
<p>There are two classes: <strong>Account</strong> with three fields (<code>code</code>, <code>balance</code>, <code>owner</code>) and <strong>User</strong> with three fields (<code>login</code>, <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>). Both classes have parameterized constructors. See the full declarations of these classes in the code template. Do not be afraid of the <code>static</code> keyword. It's not important now.</p>

<p>In the main method, create an instance of the Account class and pass it to the process method by calling <strong>process(account)</strong>. This method is already defined.</p>

<p>The instance must have the following values of the fields:</p>

<ul>
	<li>code: "123456",</li>
	<li>balance: 1000,</li>
	<li>owner: (login: "demo-user", firstName: "Alexander", lastName: "Schmidt").</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the owner is an instance of the <strong>User</strong> class.</p>

<p>See the provided template, do not change it.</p>
