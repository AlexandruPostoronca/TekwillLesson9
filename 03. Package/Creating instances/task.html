<h2>Creating instances</h2>
<p>Packages allow you to access both constructors and static methods. </p>
<p>There's a special class that is used for operating on large numbers called <code>BigInteger</code>. </p>
<p>In this task, you will need to access this class <em>without importing it</em>. Its constructor accepts only one
    argument: a string with a number (for example, "1264"). It is located in the <code>java.math</code> package. </p>
<p>You need to create an instance of this class with the number given in the method, and return it.</p>
